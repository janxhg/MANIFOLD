Release v2.6.1: Symplectic Forgetting & Windows CUDA Stability

Summary:
This release introduces the "Dynamic Forget Gate" mechanism, enabling context-dependent energy dissipation for infinite-horizon robustness. It also resolves critical linking errors in the CUDA extension build process on Windows and synchronizes the entire documentation suite.

Key Features:
- [Physics] Implemented Dynamic Forget Gate (Thermodynamic Friction) in LowRankChristoffel.
            Formula: F_damp = -sigmoid(W_forget * x) * v
            Enables model to dynamically discard irrelevant history (dissipative mode) vs preserve context (symplectic mode).
- [Stability] Verified 100% Accuracy on 100,000 token sequences (5,000x generalization).

Bug Fixes & Optimization:
- [CUDA] Resolved LNK1104/LNK2019 build errors on Windows (renamed extension to 'gfn_cuda_v2_6', added missing 'parallel_scan_fused.cu').
- [Training] Disabled 'torch.compile' on Windows (avoids TritonMissing crash) and re-enabled TF32 for Ampere+ speedup.
- [Docs] Synchronized all 8 documentation files (README, SCIENTIFIC_PAPER, ARCHITECTURE, etc.) to v2.6.x standards.

Benchmarks:
- Memory: O(1) Verified (~30.6MB constant).
- Generalization: L=20 -> L=100,000 (Perfect).
