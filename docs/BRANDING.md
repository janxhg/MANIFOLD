# MANIFOLD - Brand Guidelines

## Official Name
**MANIFOLD**

Full form: **M**ulti-scale **A**daptive **N**eural **I**nference via **F**low **O**n **L**earned **D**ynamics

## Taglines

Primary:
> "Navigate the geometry of intelligence"

Alternatives:
> "Sequence modeling through continuous flows"
> "Learn the manifold, not the mapping"
> "Where geometry meets deep learning"

## Visual Identity

### Logo Concept
- Primary: 3D curved surface (Riemannian manifold)
- Colors: 
  - Primary: `#2A9D8F` (Teal) - represents flow
  - Secondary: `#E76F51` (Coral) - represents energy
  - Accent: `#F4A261` (Gold) - represents curvature

### Typography
- Headers: Monospace (code-like, technical)
- Body: Sans-serif (clean, modern)

## Terminology

### Use This
- M-Layer (not G-Layer)
- MANIFOLD architecture
- Geodesic flow
- Christoffel symbols
- Symplectic integration

### Avoid
- GFN (internal code only)
- "Just another transformer"
- "Neural network" (too generic)

## Positioning

### What MANIFOLD Is
- A geometric approach to sequence modeling
- Physics-informed deep learning
- Continuous dynamics on learned manifolds

### What MANIFOLD Is NOT
- A transformer variant
- An RNN replacement
- Just an attention alternative

## Key Differentiators

1. **O(1) Memory** - The practical win
2. **Compositional** - The theoretical win
3. **Symplectic** - The physics win
