**Abstract**  
Contemporary neural network architectures depend on discrete embedding layers whose memory complexity scales linearly with vocabulary size ($O(V)$). This scaling imposes a critical bottleneck for models operating with massive multilingual vocabularies or high-resolution scientific data. We present **Implicit Neural Embeddings (INF)**, a framework where the discrete lookup table is replaced by a continuous neural field $\Psi$ defined on a low-dimensional manifold. Using Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIREN), we demonstrate that large-scale vocabularies can be compressed into a constant number of parameters $O(1)$ with respect to $V$, while inducing a smooth metric topology between symbols. This approach not only drastically reduces the memory footprint but enables semantic interpolation and reasoning over unseen symbols through the continuity of the functional field.

## 1. Introduction: The Problem of Symbolic Discretization

In traditional deep learning, each symbol or token $i$ in a vocabulary $\mathcal{V}$ is associated with an independent vector $\mathbf{E}_i \in \mathbb{R}^D$. This tabular representation implicitly assumes that the semantic space is a collection of isolated and disjoint points. As $V$ grows to millions of tokens, the embedding matrix dominates the model's parameter budget, limiting deployment on memory-constrained hardware.

We propose a paradigm shift: treating the vocabulary as a **Continuous Semantic Field**. Instead of storing vectors, we learn a function $\Psi$ that maps coordinates $\mathbf{c} \in \mathcal{C}$ in a low-dimensional space to dense vector representations.

## 2. Mathematical Framework of Implicit Neural Fields

### 2.1 The Functional Mapping Function
We define the embedding of a token $i$ as the value of a neural field evaluated at its corresponding coordinate $\mathbf{c}_i$:

$$ \mathbf{E}_i = \Psi(\mathbf{c}_i; \Theta) $$

where $\Psi$ is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) parameterized by $\Theta$, and $\mathbf{c}_i$ is a low-rank coordinate vector ($d \ll D$). In this scheme, knowledge about vocabulary structure is stored in the network weights $\Theta$, while token identities are preserved in the coordinate space $\mathcal{C}$.

### 2.2 Periodic Activations and High-Frequency Detail
Standard ReLU-based MLPs suffer from "spectral bias," where the network prioritizes learning low-frequency functions, failing to capture the sharp discontinuities necessary to distinguish between thousands of unique symbols in a small coordinate space. To mitigate this, we adopt architectures with periodic activation functions:

$$ \phi(x) = \sin(\omega_0 \cdot x) $$

where $\omega_0$ is a frequency factor controlling the field's bandwidth. SIREN networks enable the neural field to capture high-frequency details and represent complex functions with superior accuracy compared to traditional architectures, maintaining the high-order differentiability required for physics-based optimizations.

## 3. Numerical Stability and Spectral Initialization

The convergence of networks with sinusoidal activations is extremely sensitive to weight scaling. To ensure signal variance remains constant across layers, we use an initialization scheme where weights $W$ are drawn from a distribution scaled by the frequency:

$$ W \sim \mathcal{U}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{6/n}}{\omega_0}, \frac{\sqrt{6/n}}{\omega_0}\right) $$

This initialization prevents phase collapse and allows the neural field to distribute uniformly over the coordinate space, maximizing the model's expressive capacity to represent the complete vocabulary.

## 4. Metric Topology and Semantic Interpolation

Unlike lookup tables, INFs induce a natural topological structure. If two tokens $i, j$ have coordinates $\mathbf{c}_i, \mathbf{c}_j$ that are close in $\mathcal{C}$, their resulting embeddings will be semantically similar due to the continuity of $\Psi$.

This property enables:
1.  **Semantic Interpolation**: It is possible to explore "intermediate concepts" by evaluating the field at coordinates not assigned to specific tokens.
2.  **Noise Robustness**: Small perturbations in coordinates result in smooth embedding changes, improving training stability.
3.  **Zero-Shot Synthesis**: The ability to generate representations for new symbols simply by assigning them a position in the existing coordinate landscape.

## 5. Implicit Readout Mechanisms

The inverse process—mapping a latent state back to a symbol—can also be formulated as a neural field. Instead of a massive linear projection toward $V$ logits, we use an **Implicit Readout** that projects the latent state to coordinates in $\mathcal{C}$.

To handle the discrete nature of token selection, we employ a temperature-annealed sigmoid function:

$$ P(i | \mathbf{h}) \propto \exp\left( -\frac{\| \text{MLP}(\mathbf{h}) - \mathbf{c}_i \|^2}{\tau} \right) $$

As temperature $\tau$ decreases during training, the distribution becomes sharper, enabling a smooth transition from continuous exploration regime to discrete symbol selection.

## 6. Complexity Analysis and Parameter Efficiency

Consider a vocabulary of $V = 100,000$ tokens with an embedding dimension $D = 512$.
*   **Traditional Model**: $100,000 \times 512 \approx 51.2$ million parameters.
*   **INF Model**: Requires a coordinate table of $100,000 \times d$ (where $d=16$) plus a small $\Psi$ network (~100k parameters). Total $\approx 1.7$ million parameters.

The INF achieves an approximately **30x parameter reduction**, decoupling vocabulary growth from model complexity. In the limit, if coordinates are derived from hash functions or fixed structures, the embedding memory complexity becomes $O(1)$.

## 7. Conclusion

Implicit Neural Fields represent a fundamental shift in symbolic information management. By treating the vocabulary as a continuous field, we not only optimize computational resource utilization but endow the model with an intrinsic geometric understanding of semantics. This approach lays the foundation for architectures capable of processing vocabularies of unlimited scale with unprecedented efficiency.
