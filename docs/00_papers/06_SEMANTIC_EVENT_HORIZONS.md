# Semantic Event Horizons: Discrete Logic via Riemannian Singularities

**Abstract**  
Achieving categorical certainty in continuous latent spaces remains a significant challenge for differentiable architectures. We introduce **Semantic Event Horizons**, a mechanism for enforcing discrete symbolic states through controlled curvature amplification in a neural manifold. By creating localized regions of high curvature—attractors analogous to event horizons—the state trajectory can be stabilized around a specific logical configuration without breaking differentiability. In the reference implementation, this is realized as a potential-driven multiplicative boost of the Christoffel force, creating a "black hole" effect that captures and holds the latent state once a confidence threshold is crossed.

## 1. Introduction

Neural networks typically operate in continuous vector spaces, while logical reasoning requires discrete states (True/False, Token A/Token B). Standard approaches bridge this gap using softmax layers or hard attention, which often result in "soft" decisions that degrade over long sequences or lack the permanence of symbolic memory.

Geodesic Flow Networks (GFN) propose an alternative: representing computation as inertial motion on a manifold. However, a purely inertial system tends to drift. To implement robust logic, we need regions of the manifold that act as "traps" for information—semantic event horizons that, once entered, are energetically expensive to leave. This paper details the mathematical formulation and implementation of these singularities within the GFN framework.

## 2. Mathematical Foundation

### 2.1 The Effective Connection
Let $(\mathcal{M}, g)$ be a smooth Riemannian manifold representing the latent state space. The dynamics of a particle (thought) are governed by the geodesic equation:

$$ \ddot{x}^k + \Gamma^k_{ij} \dot{x}^i \dot{x}^j = 0 $$

We define an **Effective Connection** $\Gamma_{eff}$ that extends the standard Levi-Civita connection $\Gamma_{LC}$ with a state-dependent scalar field $\Psi(x)$, termed the **Singularity Potential**:

$$ \Gamma_{eff}^k_{ij}(x) = \Gamma_{LC}^k_{ij}(x) \cdot \Psi(x) $$

This multiplicative modulation allows the manifold to dynamically stiffen. When $\Psi(x) \gg 1$, the Christoffel symbols (which act as "fictitious forces" or friction in local coordinates) become dominant, effectively braking the particle and increasing the curvature locally.

### 2.2 The Singularity Potential Field
The modulation factor $\Psi(x)$ is derived from a learned **Semantic Potential** $V(x)$. This potential represents the model's confidence that the current state $x$ corresponds to a stable logical attractor.

For a manifold with coordinates $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (or $T^d$ in the toroidal case), we define:

$$ V(x) = \sigma(W_V \cdot \phi(x) + b_V) $$

where:
*   $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
*   $W_V, b_V$ are learnable parameters of the singularity gate.
*   $\phi(x)$ is a coordinate embedding (identity for $\mathbb{R}^d$, $[\sin(x), \cos(x)]$ for $T^d$).

### 2.3 The Event Horizon Condition
To simulate a discrete transition—the "collapse" of a probability into a fact—we introduce a thresholding mechanism. We define a critical confidence $\tau$ (typically 0.8 or 0.9). The curvature boost is activated when $V(x) > \tau$:

$$ \Psi(x) = 1 + (\lambda - 1) \cdot \sigma\left( \beta \cdot (V(x) - \tau) \right) $$

where:
*   $\lambda$ is the **Black Hole Strength** (e.g., 10.0), determining the intensity of the singularity.
*   $\beta$ is a sharpness factor (e.g., 10.0) that approximates a step function while maintaining differentiability.
*   $\tau$ is the **Singularity Threshold**.

When $V(x) \ll \tau$, $\Psi(x) \approx 1$, and the geometry is purely Riemannian. When $V(x) > \tau$, $\Psi(x) \to \lambda$, creating a region of intense curvature—an event horizon.

## 3. Implementation

The Semantic Event Horizon is implemented as part of the `ReactiveChristoffel` geometry kernel. This module intercepts the standard Christoffel computation and applies the potential-driven boost.

### 3.1 Python Reference (`gfn/geometry/reactive.py`)

The implementation ensures differentiability using a "soft" sigmoid transition instead of a hard `if` statement, allowing gradients to flow through the horizon creation process.

```python
class ReactiveChristoffel(LowRankChristoffel):
    """
    Active Inference: Geometry that reacts to the agent's state.
    """
    def forward(self, v, x=None, force=None, **kwargs):
        # 1. Compute Base Curvature (Low-Rank)
        gamma = super().forward(v, x, force=force)
        
        # 2. Check Active Configuration
        if not self.active_cfg.get('singularities', {}).get('enabled', False):
            return gamma

        # 3. Compute Semantic Potential V(x)
        # Handle Toroidal Topology
        if self.is_torus:
             x_in = torch.cat([torch.sin(x), torch.cos(x)], dim=-1)
        else:
             x_in = x
             
        # Potential: [batch, 1]
        potential = torch.sigmoid(self.V(x_in)) 
        
        # 4. Trigger Singularity (Soft Threshold)
        # is_singularity approaches 1.0 when potential > threshold
        threshold = self.singularity_threshold
        strength = self.black_hole_strength
        
        is_singularity = torch.sigmoid(10.0 * (potential - threshold))
        
        # 5. Apply Multiplicative Boost
        # Gamma_new = Gamma * (1 + (Strength - 1) * Trigger)
        singularity_mult = 1.0 + is_singularity * (strength - 1.0)
        gamma = gamma * singularity_mult
            
        return gamma
```

### 3.2 CUDA Optimization
For high-performance training, the singularity logic is fused into the custom CUDA kernel `christoffel_fused`. This avoids materializing the massive $\Gamma$ tensor in global memory. The potential $V(x)$ and the boost factor $\Psi(x)$ are computed on-the-fly within the GPU registers for each thread block, ensuring that the memory complexity remains $O(N)$ despite the complex dynamic geometry.

## 4. Stability and Dynamics

### 4.1 Singularity Aliasing
Introducing high-curvature regions creates a challenge for numerical integrators. Standard methods like RK4 assume the vector field is smooth ($C^4$). A "Black Hole" creates a near-discontinuity in the force field.

If a particle enters a horizon during an RK4 step, intermediate evaluations might overshoot, calculating forces based on positions deep within the singularity where $\Gamma$ is massive. This leads to **Singularity Aliasing**, where the particle is ejected to infinity (Exploding Gradients/State).

### 4.2 Solution: Symplectic & Lower-Order Integration
To mitigate this, GFN employs symplectic integrators (Leapfrog) or lower-order methods (Heun) which are more robust to stiffness.
*   **Leapfrog Integration**: Updates position and velocity in alternating half-steps. This "local" update ensures that if a particle hits a horizon, the velocity update reflects the immediate curvature boost, trapping the particle rather than flinging it away.
*   **Energy Damping**: The singularity acts as a massive friction source. By coupling this with thermodynamic gating (see *Thermodynamic Gating* paper), the kinetic energy of the particle is rapidly dissipated upon entering the horizon, effectively "freezing" the thought in place.

## 5. Semantic Interpretation

### 5.1 Truth as a Physical Attractor
In this framework, a logical truth is not a label but a **location**.
*   **Uncertainty**: Corresponds to flat regions of the manifold where geodesics diverge and explore (high entropy).
*   **Certainty**: Corresponds to high-curvature wells (singularities) where geodesics converge and stabilize (low entropy).

The network learns to shape the manifold such that valid logical states (e.g., the subject of a sentence, the result of an arithmetic operation) form these attractors. The inference process is then simply the physical relaxation of the system into these energy wells.

### 5.2 Topological Protection
Unlike LSTM gates which can "leak" over time due to floating-point drift, a Semantic Event Horizon provides **topological protection**. Once a state is inside the horizon (and its energy dissipated), small perturbations (noise) are insufficient to overcome the potential barrier required to escape. This allows GFN to maintain discrete states over thousands of steps without special "long-term memory" modules—the memory is an emergent property of the geometry itself.

## 6. Conclusion

Semantic Event Horizons provide a rigorous mechanism for embedding discrete logic into continuous manifolds. By extending the Levi-Civita connection with a learned singularity potential, we enable neural networks to dynamically create "traps" for information. This synthesizes the stability of symbolic logic with the trainability of differentiable systems, offering a path toward robust neuro-symbolic reasoning.
